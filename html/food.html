          Denmark wins the European Championship in gastronomy  After two days of competition with Nordic flavours in Trondheim (Norway), Denmark, represented by Sebastian Holberg Svendsgaard, took the first place on the podium at the Bocuse d'Or Europe. In the last decades, fine dining has become a thing in Denmark, and the number of Michelin star restaurants has just gone up – currently, Denmark holds 45 Michelin starts shared among 35 restaurants.

                A few years ago, Danes were asked to vote for their national dish. And the winning dish, a classic pork recipe 'stegt flæsk med persillesovs', was no surprise. The crispy pork with parsley sauce and potatoes is a very old dish that has won the hearts, and tummies, of Danes for centuries. You can try the Danes' national dish in many restaurants around Denmark. Luckily, it is actually among the cheaper eats and if you become a fan, some restaurants even offer all-you-can-eat pork at affordable prices.

              Hot dogs are the street food of choice in Copenhagen. They are served with a variety of condiments, but this particular combination is a true classic...a creamy curried remoulade sauce, fresh pickled cucumber and crispy fried onoion. It might sound a bit odd, but all of these condiments are quite common in Danish cuisine and are absolutely delicious together.

            <h3>Lagkage</h3>
            <p>
              Danish lagkage, a festive layered cake, reigns supreme at Danish celebrations. Fluffy sponge layers are interwoven with creamy delights like pastry cream and fresh fruit, or tangy fruit preserves. The cake itself can be made with different batters, and the whole masterpiece is crowned with a rich blanket of whipped cream and even more fruit. From birthdays to grand occasions, lagkage is the sweet centerpiece that brings Danes together.
